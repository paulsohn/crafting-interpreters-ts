// here is a good example of closure

fun makeCounter() {
  var i = 0;
  fun count() {
    i = i + 1;
    print i;
  }

  return count;
}

var counter = makeCounter();
counter(); // "1".
counter(); // "2".



// now here is a questionable example of closure
// without resolution, `i` can be accessed in the local function, although `i` is not even declared in the code yet.
// this is TOTALLY FINE in some languages, but it's wierd (see example below)
// so we will do some semantic analysis (resolution) before run.

// to re-enable this feature, just resolve functions later than any other sentences.

fun makeCounter2() {
  // var i = -2; // this won't affect
  fun count() {
    i = i + 1;
    print i;
  }
  var i = 4;

  return count;
}

var counter2 = makeCounter2();
counter2(); // "5".
counter2(); // "6".



// here's a more patheologic example
// without resolution, it will print "global block"
// because the associated closure has changed.

var a = "global";
{
  fun showA() {
    print a;
  }

  showA(); // in instruction-level parallelism, it might cause a race between invoking `showA` and declaring new local `a`. (?)
  var a = "block";
  showA();
}
// showA();
